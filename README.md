#  Bicycle Sales Performance Dashboard  

A Power BI dashboard analyzing sales performance for a bicycle retailer/manufacturer, focusing on **geographical trends**, **product performance**, and **revenue insights**. Built to support data-driven decisions in inventory management and regional marketing strategies.

## 🌟 **Why I Built This**  
I created this dashboard to help bicycle retailers:  
1. Identify **top-performing regions** (e.g., Northwest generated $16,084 in revenue).  
2. Optimize inventory by tracking **best-selling products** (e.g., "Mountain-200 Black, 38" with 2,977 orders).  
3. Uncover anomalies like the Southwest region’s **50% revenue contribution despite 0% orders** (data outlier).  
4. Streamline quarterly sales strategies with time-based insights.
